# R Programming Assignment

This repository contains the R script for an assignment involving data merging, cleaning, and analysis using R programming language.

## Data Merge and Integration Process

### Steps Taken:
1. **Data Capturing/Creation:**
   - Created data frames for Online Sales, In-Store Sales, Customer Demographics, Product Inventory, and Marketing Campaigns.
   
2. **Load Data into R:**
   - Loaded the created data frames into R.

3. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Ensured consistency in key fields across datasets.
   - Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized formats.
   
4. **Perform Data Merge and Integration:**
   - Merged sales data with customer demographic data based on the common key (customer ID).

5. **Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into customer behavior.
   - Calculated summary statistics and visualized the merged dataset.

6. **Validation and Quality Assurance:**
   - Validated the merged dataset against expectations.
   - Checked for data integrity and consistency.

### Decisions Made:
- Used R for data merging, cleaning, and analysis due to its powerful data manipulation capabilities.
- Chose `plotrix` package for data visualization due to its simplicity and compatibility with base R plotting functions.
